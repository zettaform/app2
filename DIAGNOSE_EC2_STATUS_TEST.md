# Diagnose EC2 Status Test

This file triggers a comprehensive diagnosis of the EC2 instance to see what's actually running.

## What this diagnosis will show:

1. **System Information** - Hostname, user, disk, memory
2. **Node.js Status** - Whether Node.js is installed and version
3. **PM2 Status** - Whether PM2 is installed and what processes are running
4. **All Node.js Processes** - Any Node.js processes currently running
5. **Network Status** - All listening ports and their processes
6. **Specific Port Checks** - Detailed check of ports 22, 80, 3001, 8080, 443
7. **Application Directories** - Check what application directories exist
8. **Running Applications** - Test if applications are responding locally
9. **Recent Logs** - Check PM2 logs for any running applications
10. **Environment** - Check environment variables

## Expected Results:

This will show us exactly what's happening on the EC2 instance and why the applications might not be accessible externally, even if they were working before.
