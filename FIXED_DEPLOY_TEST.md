# Fixed Deploy Test - Port 80 + 8080 Fallback

This file triggers the FIXED deployment that should finally get the application running.

## Fixed Deployment Features:

1. **Proper SSH Setup** - Uses webfactory/ssh-agent correctly
2. **Clean Environment** - Kills all existing processes and cleans up
3. **Fresh Node.js/PM2** - Installs Node.js and PM2 from scratch
4. **Port 80 First** - Tries port 80 (HTTP default) with sudo
5. **Port 8080 Fallback** - Falls back to port 8080 if port 80 fails
6. **PM2 Management** - Uses PM2 for proper process management
7. **Health Checks** - Tests local connectivity before declaring success
8. **Network Status** - Shows which ports are actually listening

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Application running on port 80 OR port 8080
- ✅ PM2 managing the process
- ✅ Health check endpoint working
- ✅ Network status showing listening ports
- ✅ External accessibility

## Application Endpoints:

- **Port 80**: http://52.70.4.30:80/
- **Port 8080**: http://52.70.4.30:8080/
- **Health Check**: http://52.70.4.30:80/health or http://52.70.4.30:8080/health

This is the FIXED deployment code that should finally work!
