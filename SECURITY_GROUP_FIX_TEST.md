# Security Group Fix Test

This file triggers the security group fix to open the necessary ports for the application.

## Security Group Fix Process:

1. **Find EC2 Instance** - Locates the instance with IP 52.70.4.30
2. **Get Security Group** - Identifies the security group attached to the instance
3. **Open Port 3001** - Allows inbound traffic on port 3001 (main application)
4. **Open Port 80** - Allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP default)
5. **Open Port 8080** - Allows inbound traffic on port 8080 (alternative HTTP)
6. **Verify Rules** - Shows current security group rules

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Port 3001 opened for inbound traffic
- ✅ Port 80 opened for inbound traffic
- ✅ Port 8080 opened for inbound traffic
- ✅ Application accessible from external connections
- ✅ Login functionality testable from outside

## After Security Group Fix:

The application should be accessible at:
- **Main App**: http://52.70.4.30:3001/
- **Login Test**: http://52.70.4.30:3001/api/test-login
- **Health Check**: http://52.70.4.30:3001/health

This will fix the security group configuration and make the application accessible!
