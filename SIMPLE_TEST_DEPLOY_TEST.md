# Simple Test Deploy - Just Get Something Running

This file triggers the simplest possible deployment to see if we can get ANY application running.

## Simple Test Deployment:

1. **Kill Everything** - Stop all existing processes
2. **Install Node.js** - If not already installed
3. **Create Simple App** - Minimal Express.js application
4. **Start with nohup** - Simplest process management
5. **Test Locally** - Verify it's running on the EC2 instance
6. **Check Network** - See if port 3001 is listening

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Simple test app running on port 3001
- ✅ Health check endpoint working
- ✅ Main endpoint responding
- ✅ Port 3001 listening

This will tell us if the issue is with our complex deployments or if there's a fundamental problem.
